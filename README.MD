Deferred formating, inspired by https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt

## How does it work

The macro `defmt_printf` is called like a normal `printf`. Under the hood, this macro creates two variables: 
 * the format string (the first argument passed to `defmt_printf`)
 * a placeholder for the identifier of this string

After compiling, the object file gets patched using `patch.py`. This script calculates a hash of the format
string, and places the digest into the placeholder variable created by `defmt_printf`. A dictionary is generated
to recover the contents of the format string during the decoding stage.

During linking the compiler will (hopefully) optimize away the format string since it's not used anywhere.

On runtime, the `defmt_printf` macro will call `write`, outputting the hash value and any (up to 10) arguments
to the standard output.

To recover the contents of the logs, call `decoder.py` with the dictionary generated by the patcher.

## Usage

Build the example: `make example`

Run the example: `make run`, or `./build/main | ./decoder.py dict.txt`

Run the tests: `make test`
